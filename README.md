# FHE-based "Risk" Style Game with Secret Alliances

Dive into a world of strategic alliances and betrayals where trust is a double-edged sword! Our game, **"Risk_FHE_Alliance"**, reimagines the classic "Risk" board game by incorporating **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. Players can secretly form encrypted alliances with others, adding layers of intrigue and psychological warfare, all enforced by smart contracts. The twist? Your opponents won’t know who your allies are until it's too late! 

## The Problem: Trust in a Competitive Landscape
In competitive strategy games, the key to success is often built on trust and relationships. However, the challenge arises when players must navigate alliances where one wrong move can lead to their downfall. Traditional gaming environments expose players' alliances, leading to predictable strategies and diminished excitement. How do we enhance the strategic depth while ensuring secretive yet enforceable agreements? 

## The FHE Solution: Encrypted Alliances
Our game leverages **Zama's open-source libraries**, including **Concrete**, to enable players to create FHE-encrypted treaties, such as "Non-Aggression" and "Mutual Defense". These treaties are not only hidden from opponents but are also enforced by smart contracts, ensuring that players can commit to their alliances without fear of betrayal – or at least without the certainty of exposure. 

Imagine a world where diplomatic agreements can be made without the risk of leaking sensitive information! With this technology, players can engage in psychological and strategic gameplay without compromising their positions. 

## Key Features: Gameplay Mechanics
- **FHE-encrypted Alliances**: Players can create secret agreements enforced by smart contracts, adding complexity to the gameplay.
- **Dynamic Treaty Triggers**: The execution of treaties becomes dynamic and interactive, with terms defined by the gameplay context.
- **Enhanced Psychological Play**: The element of betrayal becomes more dramatic, as players must ascertain who they can trust.
- **Global Strategy**: Traverse a beautifully designed world map while engaging in warfare and diplomacy.

## Technology Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Confidential Computing**: 
  - **Zama SDK**: Utilizes Zama's libraries such as Concrete for FHE functionalities.
- **Development Tools**: Node.js, Hardhat for testing and deploying Smart Contracts.

## Installation Guide
To set up your development environment, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: Make sure to install Node.js, which comes with npm.
2. **Hardhat**: This is essential for Ethereum development and testing.

Once you have these prerequisites, follow the steps below:

1. Download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install`. This command will automatically install all dependencies, including the required Zama FHE libraries.

*Note: Please do not use `git clone` or any URLs to acquire this project.*

## Build & Run Guide
To compile and test the contracts, use the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Compile the Contracts**:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

2. **Run Tests**:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat test
    ```

3. **Deploy to Local Network**:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
    ```

### Code Example: Creating an Alliance
Here’s a simple code snippet that demonstrates how players can initiate a secret alliance in our game:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Risk_FHE_Alliance {
    struct Treaty {
        address ally;
        string terms;
        bool isActive;
    }

    mapping(address => Treaty[]) public treaties;

    function createTreaty(address _ally, string memory _terms) public {
        treaties[msg.sender].push(Treaty({
            ally: _ally,
            terms: _terms,
            isActive: true
        }));
    }

    function executeTreaty(address _ally) public {
        // Logic to enforce the treaty goes here, utilizing FHE capabilities
        // Example: using Zama's FHE to ensure the treaty's execution
    }
}
```

In this example, players create alliances that can be enforced through smart contract logic, enhancing the gameplay experience while ensuring confidentiality.
